## Introduction

New York City (NYC) is the largest city in the United States, and one of the most influential cities in the world. It has a population of 8,175,133 as of 2010. It's a very diverse city with people from all around the world. 

According to Wikipedia, crime has been steadily falling in NYC since the early 1990s, and it is considered to be one of the safest city in the world. The city of New York is divided into  5 boroughs (administrative divisions). It would be interesting to analyse the types and number of crimes committed in the different boroughs of New York City.

I plan to analyse the New York City Complaint Data, which, according to the webpage, contains "all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes". I will not be using the entire dataset, as it spans from 2006 to 2017. I will be using data from 2006 and 2017, so two years worth of data. 

My plan is to do an analysis on the number of reported crimes in 2006 and 2017. My goal is to identify trends in the crime rate and discover insight in the number and types of crimes committed in the city as well as the boroughs that the city is divided into. 

The reasons for higher crime rate are many and varied. Some included poverty due to inequitable distribution of wealth, lack of opportunities, politics, violence in media etc. Oftentimes, an increase in the number of police will do no good to control or reduce crime until these causes of crimes are addressed. 

I hope that my analysis will allow people to get a better understanding about the type and kinds of crime that occur in the city and at a deeper level, in the borough that they live in. I'm hoping this analysis will allow people who live in NYC to be better prepared and aware of their surroundings, and reduce the chance of them becoming victims of criminal activity. The raw data is tough to analyse, and I hope my analysis will make things much more interpretable. 

## Data

I will be using the **NYPD Complaint Data Historic** dataset. According to the webpage, this dataset "includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the end of last year (2017)." The data is available as a part of the NYC OpenData program. This  data is publicly available and there are no restrictions regarding the usage of the data. 

The about page available [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/data/about.html) clearly states that anyone can use the data available on the NYC Open Data site. I reproduce the relevant parts of the about page below. 

> NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. As part of an initiative to improve the accessibility, transparency, and accountability of City government, this catalog offers access to a repository of government-produced, machine-readable data sets. Anyone can use these data sets to participate in and improve government by conducting research and analysis or creating applications, thereby gaining a better understanding of the services provided by City agencies and improving the lives of citizens and the way in which government serves them.

### NYPD Complaint Data Historic

This dataset contains all valid crimes that were reported to the NYPD from 2006 till the end of 2017. These crimes include felonies, misdemeanors and other violent crimes. The dataset is very comprehensive, containing 6,036,095 rows of reported crime. You can download the data as a dump containing all the data, or programmatically access it using the Socrata Open Data (SODA) API. There are 35 columns in the dataset. To make things easy for the user of the dataset, a data dictionary (available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/qgea-i56i/files/ee823139-888e-4ad0-badf-e18e2674a9cb?download=true&filename=NYPD_Complaint_Historic_DataDictionary.xlsx)) provides a comprehensive description of the different columns and what they contain. My final repository will also contain this dictionary to make things easier for the end user. A description of the columns is shown below:

The data will need to be processed before it can be used for my analysis. The first and most obvious step is to filter the data so that it contains events from 2006 and 2017 only, as my analysis deals with data in this date range. I will filter the data and place it as a CSV in the repository to ensure reproducibility of my results.

I also anticipate that a number of columns will not really serve me any purposes. These columns will need to be removed after further analysis of the data that I conduct during my research. A number of columns appear redundant as well, so I will need to remove them to make the data cleaner and more usable. 

#### Potential Limitations of the data

- There is a chance that the data may be contain a number of missing values. In this case, I will have to determine how to deal with these data points in the best possible way for my analysis.
- The data is also very large (1.8 gigabytes). This number will certainly go down after I perform the filtering operation, but I will need to think of ways to make my research reproducible in case the data does not fit on the Github repository.
- The data does not list the gender of both the victim or the suspect. It lists the sex, which is binary in nature. Gender is not binary, and can be changed. The data only contains binary sex as a descriptor. This is a limitation, as the NYPD has incidents of discrimination and harrassment against queer individuals. For this reason, this data would have served quite a useful purpose to determine whether crimes against queer and non-binary individuals were underreported. Without this data, this analysis becomes impossible, as the sex does not address this question.

## Analysis That Will Be Conducted

I anticipate this to be a research project where I use the data that I collect to answer a number of research questions. 

### Research Question 1:

**How clean is the data? Are there any obvious problems or issues with the numbers?**

I want to see if there are any issues with the data that stand out and are quite obvious, and may impede my analysis. 

### Research Question 2:

**What's the overall trend in the number of reported incidents in 2006 as compared to 2017 in NYC? How about the trend in crimes reported on a borough basis?** 

Without giving any consideration to the nature of the crime, I want to see how the numbers compare between 2006 and 2017. I want to do this for the whole city, and then investigate the numbers for each borough and see how they look like. *My hypothesis is that the overall and borough numbers have fallen from 2006 to 2017, as most literature available online seems to say so. It will be interesting to see if this actually holds true.* 

### Research Question 3:

**Taking into consideration the actual offense, how does the number look like when 2006 and 2017 are compared? How are the numbers when they are compared for the overall city and when they are split up according to the boroughs?** 

In this research question, I take into consideration the actual nature of the crime, and see how the numbers compare between 2006 and 2017. I do this on a overall city basis and borough basis. *My hypothesis is again, that the numbers have fallen from 2006 to 2017.* 

### Research Question 4:

**Is there any element of seasonality with regards to the number of crimes committed?**

I want to see if there is any seasonality associated with the crimes committed. *My hypothesis is that crime is most likely to be committed during certain periods, like the holiday season.*

### Research Question 5 (Potential):

**Are crimes against minorities underreported?**

One thing that the NYPD institutes is a stop and frisk policy, where they stop random individuals and conduct searches on them. There is also a history of racial bias in the police department. I want to investigate whether this leads to underreported crime rates among minorities. *My hypothesis is that this is improving, and the underreporting rates have gotten lower in the past few year.* My data has race as a feature, but I'm still a little unsure as to whether the data can answer this question. This is something I will need to further investigate as I get a chance to analyse my data set. 

## Deliverables and Toolset

The deliverables will be in the form of a Jupyter notebook that contains all the code, outputs and visualizations that are conducted. The end user will be able to re-run all the code and get back the exact same results that I've gotten.

For this analysis, I will be using Python 3.6 with a number of different packages for analysis. For data processing and munging, I will be using the Pandas library. For plotting, I'll be using Matplotlib. 

Since the data I'll be using isn't in the tens of millions, this analysis will be conducted on my Macbook Pro Early 2015 model, which has a dual core Intel Core i5 processor, 8 gigabytes of ram and an internal GPU. In case my system proves too weak for the task, I will revert to using an AWS EC2 instance to conduct my analyses. 

# Human Centered Influences

As a Data Scientist, I do not want to have a laser focus on compensation and personal achievements. The reason I chose this project is because it has the potential to help people better understand crime and take reasonable actions to prevent themselves from being victims.  

Human centered design also plays a big role in methodology that I use for the analysis. The work will be fully reproducible and the data that I use will be easily available. The research can be viewed and reproduced by simply cloning the repo.
